## Learning Objectives

By the end of this sub-unit you will be able to:

- [ ] [Objective 1 — use an active verb: compute, define, interpret, apply, derive]
- [ ] [Objective 2]
- [ ] [Objective 3]

---

## Prerequisites

This sub-unit assumes:
- [Concept assumed from prior unit or module]
- [Second concept if applicable]

If either of these feels shaky, visit the refresher before continuing:
- → [`refreshers/[topic-name]/`](../../refreshers/[topic-name]/notes.md) — [one-line description]

---

## [Section 1 — Introduce the Core Concept]

[Open with the key idea in plain language before any formalism. One or two sentences answering: what is this, and why does it matter for our purposes?]

**Definition.** [State the definition precisely.]

$$
[Key equation or definition in display math]
$$

where:
- $[symbol]$ — [meaning]
- $[symbol]$ — [meaning]

[Immediately follow the definition with interpretation. What does this definition *mean* geometrically, computationally, or statistically? What would change if one of the parameters changed?]

> **Notation check.** [Brief note on any notation that may be unfamiliar or that differs from other textbooks. This course uses... ]

---

## [Section 2 — Build Intuition / Extend the Concept]

[One or two further ideas that develop the core concept. Add a second definition, a theorem, or a geometric interpretation.]

**Theorem / Proposition.** *(optional heading)* [State the result.]

$$
[Display math if needed]
$$

*Proof sketch (optional):* [If a brief proof or derivation adds insight, include it here. If it would take more than half a page, reference the appendix or omit.]

[Concrete, specific examples in prose. Resist the urge to list — write in connected sentences that build understanding.]

---

## [Section 3 — Additional Structure or Special Cases]

[A third idea, special case, or caveat. This section is optional — if the concept is complete in two sections, omit this one. Do not pad.]

---

## Worked Example

**Example.** [State the problem clearly and completely before solving it.]

$$
f(x, y) = [specific function]
$$

**Solution.**

**Step 1 — [Brief label for what this step does].**

$$
[Computation or derivation]
$$

[One sentence explaining what just happened and why.]

**Step 2 — [Label].**

$$
[Next step]
$$

[Explanation.]

**Step 3 — [Label].**

$$
[Result]
$$

[Interpret the result. What does this answer mean? Does it make geometric sense? Is it consistent with intuition?]

---

## Watch Out

> ⚠ [Common misconception, easy error, or notational trap specific to this concept. Be concrete — describe the mistake, not just the principle.]

---

## Statistical Bridge

> 🔗 **[PD / MLE / BAY / GLM]** — [One or two paragraphs connecting this unit's concept to the statistical thread(s) indicated. Make the connection explicit and concrete: name the formula, the method, or the object in the statistical context that uses this calculus. This should feel like a preview, not a proof — the detailed treatment comes in the Bridge modules.]

**Example connection.** [If possible, show a specific formula from the statistical context where today's concept appears directly.]

$$
[Statistical formula that uses today's calculus concept]
$$

---

## Summary

| Concept | Key Formula / Result |
|---|---|
| [Core concept 1] | $[Formula]$ |
| [Core concept 2] | $[Formula]$ |
| [Core concept 3] | $[Formula or result]$ |

---

## Up Next

**Exercises** (`exercises.tex`) — [One sentence describing what the exercises will have you do. Sets expectations before the student opens the file.]

**Python Lab** (`python-lab.ipynb`) — [One sentence describing what the lab visualizes or implements. What will you *see* that you couldn't see from the notes alone?]

---

## Further Reading

- [Reference 1 — Author, Title, Chapter/Section. One sentence on what it adds beyond these notes.]
- [Reference 2]
