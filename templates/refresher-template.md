## What This Refresher Covers

[Two to four sentences. What specific concepts does this refresher address? What level of prior exposure does it assume? What it deliberately does *not* cover — keep scope narrow.]

---

## Why You Are Here

You've been linked to this refresher from a sub-unit that uses **[concept name]** without re-deriving it from scratch. If [brief description of what the assumption felt like — "the chain rule notation felt unfamiliar" / "you couldn't recall how to multiply matrices"], this refresher will resolve that gap in about [10–20] minutes.

If you're arriving from the [Refresher Index](../../REFRESHER_INDEX.md) and aren't sure you need this, look at the **Quick Check** section below first.

---

## Quick Check

Can you answer the following from memory?

- [ ] [Question 1 — the simplest test of whether the concept is already fluent]
- [ ] [Question 2]
- [ ] [Question 3]

If yes to all three, you don't need this refresher. Return to the sub-unit that linked you here.

If no to any of them, continue below.

## [Section 1 — Core Concept]

[State the concept clearly and concisely. This is not a textbook chapter — it is a targeted review. Lead with the thing the student needs to remember, not with history or motivation.]

$$
[Key formula or definition]
$$

where $[symbol]$ means [definition] and $[symbol]$ means [definition].

[Two to four sentences of interpretation. What does this formula *do*? When do you use it?]

---

## [Section 2 — The Part People Forget]

[Identify the specific aspect of this concept that is most commonly misremembered or misapplied. Address it directly.]

> ⚠ **Common mistake.** [Describe the error concretely. E.g., "Students often forget to apply the chain rule to the inner function — the result looks like $f'(x)$ but should be $f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$."]

---

## [Section 3 — Additional Case or Extension (Optional)]

[If the concept has a second form or a common variant that appears in the course material, cover it here. If not, omit this section entirely. Do not pad.]

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 — [Brief Description]

**Problem.** [State the problem.]

**Solution.**

$$
[Step 1]
$$

$$
[Step 2]
$$

$$
[Result]
$$

[One sentence of interpretation.]

---

### Example 2 — [Brief Description]

**Problem.** [State a second, slightly different problem that exercises the concept from a different angle.]

**Solution.**

$$
[Solution]
$$

[Interpretation.]

## Notation Reference

| Symbol | Meaning | First appears |
|---|---|---|
| $[symbol]$ | [meaning] | [Module / Unit] |
| $[symbol]$ | [meaning] | [Module / Unit] |

## Python Lab

[**If a Python lab exists for this refresher:**]

A Python lab (`python-lab.ipynb`) is available in this folder. It [visualizes / demonstrates / implements] [brief description]. Running it is optional but recommended if visual intuition for this concept would help.

[**If no Python lab:**]

No Python lab for this refresher. The concept is best reinforced through the worked examples above and by returning to the sub-unit exercises.

---

## Return to Course

You arrived here from: **[Module XX, Unit YY — Unit Title]**
Return link: [`modules/module-XX-title/unit-YY-title/notes.md`](../../modules/module-XX-title/unit-YY-title/notes.md)

When you return, you should be able to [specific thing the sub-unit assumes you can do, now that you've completed this refresher].

## Further Reading

If this refresher has surfaced a deeper gap — more than just a memory refresh is needed — consult:

- [Reference 1 — Author, Title, specific chapter. One sentence on why this source is good for this concept.]
- [Reference 2]
